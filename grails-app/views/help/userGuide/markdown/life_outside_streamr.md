#Life outside Streamr

You can easily get your own data out of Streamr. There are several ways of doing so:

- You can create [dashboards](#dashboards) which display live data from  a Streamr canvas.
- You can use [embedded widgets](#embeddedwidgets) in external web pages.
- You can subscribe to a stream in external web pages and applications.
- You can drive external services with HTTP requests.

We've already discussed the first two methods. In this chapter, we describe -- at a non-technical level -- of how the subscription mechanism works, and give an example of what you can do with it. We'll also give examples of using external services.

**TODO: EXTEND THIS CHAPTER.**
